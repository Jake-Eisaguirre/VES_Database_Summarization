## Connect to `ribbitr` database

```{r}

## Query VES 'flavored' data

### All VES Data

```{r}

ves_q <- "select l.location, r.region, s.site, v.date, s2.detection_type, v2.species_ves, v2.count
          from location l
          join region r on l.location_id = r.location_id
          join site s on r.region_id = s.region_id
          join visit v on s.site_id = v.site_id
          join survey s2 on v.visit_id = s2.visit_id
          join ves v2 on s2.survey_id = v2.survey_id;"

#### tally count per species on grouping of location, region, site, and date
#### add year column for summarization
all_ves_data <- dbGetQuery(connection, ves_q) %>% 
  group_by(location, region, site, date, species_ves) %>% 
  reframe(count = n()) %>% 
  rename(species = species_ves) %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date))

```

### Panama Capture VES Flavored Data

```{r}

p_capture <- "select l.location, r.region, s.site, v.date, v.survey_time, s2.detection_type, v2.species_capture
             from location l
             join region r on l.location_id = r.location_id 
             join site s on r.region_id = s.region_id 
             join visit v on s.site_id = v.site_id 
             join survey s2 on v.visit_id = s2.visit_id 
             join capture v2 on s2.survey_id = v2.survey_id
             where l.location = 'panama';"

#### tally count per species on grouping of location, region, site, and date
#### add year column for summarization
panama_capture_data <- dbGetQuery(connection, p_capture) %>% 
  group_by(location, region, site, date, species_capture) %>% 
  reframe(count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(date) %>% 
  rename(species = species_capture) %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date))


```

#### `rbind` Panama Captures with all VES

```{r}

all_ves_flavored <- rbind(all_ves_data, panama_capture_data)
  

```

## Sierra Nevada

-   Per Site: 1 VES survey + 3 CMR surveys. Usually the day before CMR or the first day of CMR conducted concurrently with CMR.
-   Attempt bi-annual survey period
    -   Summer only
    - each CMR site (of which there are ~50 site IDs located in ~20 basins) is visited twice a summer with visits spaced about a          month apart. The goal is to conduct a 3-day CMR, and to conduct a VES on day 0 (prior to CMR) or day 1 of the primary period        for each visit. The only exception to this study design is Dog lake, which we visit 3-6 times in a summer conducting 1-day CMR       while conducting VES concurrently.

There are a number of sites that we visit annually and a large group of sites (500-800?) that we visit every decade or so where we just conduct VES. 

## Panama

-   Per Site: 3 day surveys + 1 night survey (attempt at every site)
    - capture every organism they see (capture). If not able to capture, record visual observation (VES). Attempt to ID and record every organism heard (aural).
    - capture and VES can be used together as no one single organism would be captured and VES data point.
    - See above query for utilizing both panama capture and VES to get raw counts.
-   Bi-annual survey period (June/July and November/December)
    -   straddles transition period of rainy to dry or dry to rainy season.
    
## Penn

- Per Site: 3 Aural survey + 3 VES surveys + 1 (or 2) Capture surveys
  - 
- Attempt bi-annual survey period
  - Summer to early fall
